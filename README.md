# LinkedIn Job Tracker — Automated Job Search Engine

**Stop searching manually. Let the machine do it.**

Automatically hunts LinkedIn every 30 minutes across 57 keyword + city combinations, classifies companies by tier, deduplicates everything, and writes clean structured data directly to Google Sheets — 24/7, zero manual effort.

## The Problem

Every CS student and job seeker knows this pain:

- Open LinkedIn → search manually → copy job link → check if you already saved it → repeat 50 times
- Spend **2–3 hours daily** just finding jobs, not applying
- Miss great opportunities because you didn't search at the right time
- No system. No structure. Just chaos.

**This project eliminates that entirely.**

---

## How It Works

![Workflow Diagram](workflow-diagram.svg)

1. **Trigger** — Fires automatically every 30 minutes via scheduler
2. **Search** — 57 parallel searches across keywords, cities, time windows
3. **Parse** — Extracts company, title, location, skills, salary from raw data
4. **Classify** — Tags every company as Tier1 / Tier2 / Tier3 / Tier4
5. **Deduplicate** — Checks against every job ID ever written — zero repeats ever
6. **Write** — Appends only new jobs to Google Sheets instantly

## The Story Behind This

This didn't come in one shot.

```
V1 — fetched 2 jobs. duplicates everywhere.
V2 — dedup fixed. but missed half the listings.
V3 — added more searches. crashed after 10 min.
V4 — stable. but only 5 jobs per run. not enough.
V5 — expanded keywords. 20 jobs. but wrong roles showing.
V6 — added filters. clean data. but scheduler broke.
V7 — scheduler fixed. but last node never ran.
V8 — 57 searches. 110+ jobs. zero duplicates. runs every 30 min. ✅
```

8 versions. Countless bugs. Zero shortcuts.
